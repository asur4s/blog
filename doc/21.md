# issue 8ï¼šGithub repo link on crates.io is broken 

https://crates.io/crates/stretch2 points to https://github.com/dioxuslabs/dioxus, but should point to this repo.

---

```toml
edition = "2021"
include = ["src/**/*", "Cargo.toml"]
description = "High performance & cross-platform Flexbox implementation"
- repository = "https://github.com/DioxusLabs/stretch"
+ repository = "https://github.com/DioxusLabs/stretch"
keywords = ["ios", "android", "cross-platform", "layout", "flexbox"]
categories = ["gui"]
license-file = "LICENSE"
```
So easy, I can too!

# issue 12: Broken bintray badge in README.md 

Seems to be a link to kotlin integration?

---


all the badges in the readme are related to the original crate and should be fixed (crates.io) or removed (circleci (replaced by GitHub action), npm (js/ts), pod(swift), bintray(kotlin)) until building and releasing is handled for those other languages

```markdown
# Stretch2
[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/stretch/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/stretch/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/stretch2.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/stretch2)
```

# issue 13: Add mdlint to CI

We have a bit of markdown now, and the amount will increase over time.

This is helpful to avoid frustrating formatting diffs and surprising rendering.

---

```yml
  markdownlint:
    name: Markdown Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          # Full git history is needed to get a proper list of changed files within `super-linter`
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Run Markdown Lint
        uses: docker://ghcr.io/github/super-linter:slim-v4
        env:
          # VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE: false
          VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE: true
          VALIDATE_MARKDOWN: true
          DEFAULT_BRANCH: master
```


# issue 18: Investigate circle-ci repository link in Cargo.toml

n Cargo.toml, there is still a reference to the vislyhq/stretch repository for a circle-ci badge.

I'm not really sure what this means, but I assume it will have to either be removed or updated to point to DioxusLabs/stretch.
```rust
[badges]
circle-ci = { repository = "vislyhq/stretch", branch = "master" }
maintenance = { status = "experimental" }
```

# issue 21: Add #![forbid(unsafe_code)] crate-level rule


Currently, there's no use of unsafe code, and we should keep it that way.

---

```rust
- let prev_id = unsafe { self.forest.remove_child(node_id, child_id) };
+ let prev_id = self.forest.remove_child(node_id, child_id);
```

# issue 23: Enable no_std option

This is commonly desired within the `games ecosystem`, and if we can swing it, would be a good fit for a foundational crate like this.

---

I think this is already the case when the std feature is disabled:
```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
```

# issue 26: 

Upstream is abandoned, so we should investigate any relevant open issues and PRs, and migrate them here as is appropriate.

# issue 29: Create issue templates

The bug template here is particularly useful: [bevyengine/bevy#4652](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4652)

I would also probably grab the Enhancement issue template from Bevy.



# issue 30: PR template

**Create a PR template**

This is helpful to ensure that PRs are **well-described and easy to review**. Feel free to steal from https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md

Steal from ..... ahaha.
